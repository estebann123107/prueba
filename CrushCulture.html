My God, don't look at your phone
No one's gonna call you
Quit checking your volume (crush)
I don't care if I'm forever alone
I'm not falling for you
'Cause this baby is loveproof (culture)

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't wanna participate in your game of manipulation (crush)
And no, I don't want your sympathy, all this love is suffocating
Just let me be sad and lonely

'Cause
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
I know what you're doin', trying to get me to pursue you
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
Spill my guts out, spill my guts out

Oh, no, don't look in their eyes
'Cause that's how they get you
Kiss you then forget you (crush)
All they feedin' you is beautiful lies
So hide in the bathroom
'Til they find someone else new (culture)

I don't care what you're saying
I don't wanna participate in your game of manipulation (crush)
And no, I don't want your sympathy, all this love is suffocating
Just let me be sad and lonely

'Cause
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
I know what you're doin', trying to get me to pursue ya
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
Spill my guts out, spill my guts out

Shut your damn mouth
You're talking too loud
And no one cares if you two made out
I'm sick of the kissing cult

Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
I know what you're doin', trying to get me to pursue ya
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
Spill my guts out, spill my guts out

Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
I know what you're doin', trying to get me to pursue ya
Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out
Spill my guts out, spill my guts out
