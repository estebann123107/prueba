                        Oh, I don't really care if you like me or not
But I know that you want me to
Oh, anythin' I do, I know you're gonna watch
To rumor up that I'm a fool
You and all your friends have to walk in a squad
'Cause y'all are so insecure
Oh, overcompensate 'cause you're sizin' me up
The oldest trick in the book

There's nothin' you could do
To dampen up my mood
There's nothing you could say
Won't like you anyways
I know that you've been hurt
Don't mean that it's our turn
Mmm

'Cause I know what you really want
A little more confidence
This is where it's gotta stop
I'm tired of hearin' it
You're just gonna be a fraud
Oh, with nothin' but fickle friends
Greek God, good God
Greek God

I don't really like how you never shut up
'Cause you got dirt on everyone
And since you always swear that you wanted me gone
Then why don't you go get your gun?
'Cause you don't really hate me
(You're a little baby)
You don't wanna end me
(You wanna befriend me)
And it's not surprising
(I can see you smiling)
Every time you kick me
You're not gonna win me

'Cause I know what you really want
A little more confidence
This is where it's gotta stop
I'm tired of hearin' it
You're just gonna be a fraud
Oh, with nothin' but fickle friends
Greek God, good God
Greek God

I don't care about your little threats
All the kids in your clique are pretend
I don't mind when you play with my head
I flip around, play with yours instead
I don't like what you said to my friends
One day you're gonna regret
Ever messin' with them

'Cause I know what you really want
A little more confidence
This is where it's gotta stop
I'm tired of hearin' it
You're just gonna be a fraud
Oh, with nothin' but fickle friends
Greek God, good God
Greek God
