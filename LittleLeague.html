                        Do you remember days on our old block?
Messing with our neighbors who called the cops
Coulda swore that you and me
Could get away with anything

We'd lay on the grass all day talking
'Cause we snuck out of class when no one was watching
I remember you and me
Yeah, I remember everything

But lately I've been feeling strange
And everybody's telling me to act my age
I never thought that everything I had would fade away

When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when we were younger
We wore our hearts right on our sleeves
Why did we ever have to leave?
Little league

Could I get a rewind?
Get another chance, take it back in time
'Cause I don't know what to do
With everything I'm going through

And where did all my friends go?
Standing on our street but nobody's home
Swore we'd never move away
But now I'm going ninety five on the interstate

'Cause lately I've been feeling strange
And everybody's telling me to act my age
I never thought that everything I had would fade away

When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when we were younger
We wore our hearts right on our sleeves
Why did we ever have to leave?
Little league

I wish I was younger (I was younger)
I wish I was younger (I was younger)

When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free
Little league
And when were younger
We wore our hearts right on our sleeves
Why did we ever had to leave?
Little league
