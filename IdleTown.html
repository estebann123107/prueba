                        This town will never change
                        People come and go, it's all the same
                        Speed the roads on our doubting days
                        To any place that's far away

                        I never learned anybody's name
                        We all vowed that we wouldn't stay
                        Kissing signs on the interstate
                        All we do for now is sit and wait

                        In our idle town

                        In our idle town

                        Yeah, we invent our own little games (In our idle town)
                        When the lights out at the stadium fade (In our idle town)
                        Making life a spinning arcade (in our idle town)
                        And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise

                        We watch the sunrise

                        We watch the sun

                        Springtime when the air is thin
                        We're getting antsy and they're noticing
                        While everybody's off partying
                        We're watching stars over ice cream

                        And now we're kicking up to seventh gear
                        And we're breathing in the atmosphere
                        I don't even need a sip of beer
                        I can feel it all

                        In our idle town
                        In our idle town

                        Yeah, we invent our own little games (In our idle town)
                        When the lights out at the stadium fade (In our idle town)
                        Making life a spinning arcade (In our idle town)
                        And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
                        We watch the sunrise

                        We watch the sun

                        And they watched the sunrise
                        Blinking out of red eyes, and sore minds

                        The airplanes keep flying by, and they cry
                        'Cause they've never even touched the sky

                        No, they'll never even touch the sky
                        Yeah, we invent our own little games (In our idle town)
                        And everybody's trying to escape (In our idle town)
                        Killing time at the yellow cafe (In our idle town)

                        And curfew's at midnight (In our idle town)
                        Yeah, I think that we'll all be okay (In our idle town)
                        The idle town will stay as it stays (In our idle town)
                        And everyone I love's in this place (In our idle town)
                        So, curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
