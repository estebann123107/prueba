                        Let me tell you a story
About a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring
But the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen
When the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves
And now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn

And when I was younger
I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other
But always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another
But never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

Now it's on to the sequel
About me and my friend
Both our parents were evil
So we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved
We could both run away
And we'd have a better life
And I was right
I wonder if she's alright

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

Okay
And the movie's always running in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
